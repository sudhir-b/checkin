TODOs

 - asynchronously get the device MAC address?
   - will be a useful exercise anyway

 - add ability to unregister devices and users

 - add view for registered devices and users

 - add styling to pages

 - how do I deploy this properly on the local network?
   - do I need a different database?

 - external password-protected API to be able to query the database?
   - probably don't want this - security risk & would need port-forwarding I think
